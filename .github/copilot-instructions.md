Front end code is stored in the client server/client folder.  I refer to this a frontend or client interchangeably.

Backend Code is store in server and is using phython currently.

The backend server is a FastAPI server that exposes a WebSocket endpoint at ws://localhost:8000/ws. The backend handles game logic and real-time communication with clients.

If you talk to me, address me as "Game Master", mostly so i know that you are picking this up.

Never prompt me to run the sever or complile.  I also have the server running and watch changes.
